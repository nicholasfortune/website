# My Personal Website
This is my personal website. I use it as a resume, a portfolio, and as a general central hub for all my online projects.

## Background
In March of 2025, I decided I needed a website to stand out from other potential employees, so I got to work, and four weeks later I had a ugly, yet functional website built it from scratch with cold, hard, raw html. With minor touchups here and there for the next month or so, I got my website polished and better than ever. Since then, I've spent over 100 hours refining my website, and with a major overhaul fall of 2025, it is officially complete. Not only does it look awesome to employers, schools, friends, and family, but building it has been an incredible learning experience. I can now confidently say I'm fluent in HTML and CSS, and I encourage others to try building a site from scratch as well.

## Features
 - Responsive Design
	This website is media query-heavy. Every single page has been optimized for both performance, aesthetics, and accessibility on mobile and desktop alike.
 - Performance-Focused
	Every non-critical image will lazy load, and every image is heavily compressed for small screens, while reserving high-quality images for large screens, and using modern media formats like WEBP for sub 1-second page loads even on slow networks.
 - User Experience
	Lightweight JavaScript controls blur, opacity, zoom, and other interactive effects based on how much the user scrolls
